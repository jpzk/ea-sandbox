# Experiments

## Experiment A

15+100 EA with tangent constraint on sphere function, best fitness is minimum. 20 samples per method. Methods: WithoutMetaModel with Death Penalty and SVCBestWeighted with beta = 0.5.

## Experiment B

15+100 EA with tangent constraint on sphere function, best fitness is minimum. 50 samples per method. Methods: WithoutMetaModel with Death Penalty and SVCSlidingWeighted with Sliding Window Size = 50 and SVCBestWeighted with beta = 0.5.

## Experiment C 

15+100 EA with tangent constraint on sphere function, best fitness is minimum. 200 samples per method. Methods: WithoutMetaModel with Death Penalty and SVCSlidingWeighted with Sliding Window Size = 50, beta = 0.5 and SVCBestWeighted with beta = 0.5.

## Experiment D 

15+100 EA with tangent constraint on sphere function, best fitness is minimum. 200 samples per method. Methods: WithoutMetaModel with Death Penalty and SVCSlidingWeighted with Sliding Window Size = 50, beta = 0.75 and SVCBestWeighted with beta = 0.75.
