This repository is a public repository for some of my evolutionary-algorithms I implemented. Use it as an alternative example for these algorithms, just in case you want to learn evolutionary algorithms, which is great! The publication of Hans-Georg Beyer and Hans-Paul Schwefel [http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~pxt/NIL/es.pdf](PDF-file) is a comprehensive introduction to evolution strategies. In the following descriptions are illustrated. 

## Basic information

(1+1) means (mu+lambda), which is common in literature. mu is the amount of individuals to select and lambda is the amount of individuals to generate by mutation. There are two types of selection the plus- and comma-selection. The plus-selection considers old population and mutated population when selecting the fittest for the next generation. The comma-selection only takes account of the mutated population.
